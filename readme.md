Here in this program I have tried to implement the Chess Game logic.

Intitally I have taken a 5 x 5 grid matrix which is initialized with "-".

After that the player inputs are taken in array, for player 1 the grid is filled using the last row, for player 2, I have used the first row to store the values.

Once the values were stored, the game is ready to start.

With every move input, I am searching for that piece on the grid for that particular player.

Once the piece is found and if the move is valid then I am moving the piece.

Although I couldn't implement the checkmate logic and also the level 2 and level 3 logic.
